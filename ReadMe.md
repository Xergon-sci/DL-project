## How to do inference

## Project overview

* The `experimental` folder contains some preliminary code for exploration of the dataset and a basic model.
* The `production` folder contains the code to train the model, training was done on Hydra for speed.
* The `inference` file contains the code to make predictions from.

The code for calculating the accuracy was inspired on [the official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#test-the-network-on-the-test-data).
