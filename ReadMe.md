## How to do inference

1. Setup the conda environment with: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate dl-proj`
3. Run `inference.py`. By default, it will make predictions on the handwriting of me and some of my collegues.
4. To use your own image, change the `IMAGEPATH` variable to were you have stored the image. The only requirement is that the image should be a square. (Let's say as captured by some object detection.)

## Project overview

* The `experimental` folder contains some preliminary code for exploration of the dataset and a basic model.
* The `production` folder contains the code to train the model, training was done on Hydra for speed.
* The `inference` folder contains the code to make predictions from.

The code for calculating the accuracy was inspired on [the official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#test-the-network-on-the-test-data).
